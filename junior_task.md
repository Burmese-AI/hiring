# Task: Build a Transaction Audit Dashboard

**Domain:** Financial Transaction Auditing  
**Expected Time:** 8–16 Hours (AI collaboration encouraged)

---

## Objective

Build a **Transaction Audit Dashboard** using Django and HTMX to display, filter, and approve financial transactions.

- **Backend/System Design**: Must be **80% your own work** (we’ll assess your decisions).
- **Frontend**: You may **fully delegate to AI Agents in the code editors** (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, etc.), but you must **understand and able to explain** all generated code.

---

## Requirements

1. **Transaction Model & Data**  
   - Define a `Transaction` model with fields: `amount`, `status`, `timestamp`, `merchant`, and `is_flagged` (for compliance).
   - You may add more fields to the model as you see fit.
   - Seed mock data (e.g., 1000 to 10000 transactions via Django fixtures or a script).  

2. **Frontend Dashboard (HTMX is not required, but encouraged)**
   - Display transactions in a table with columns: `Merchant`, `Amount`, `Status`, `Flagged`.  
   - Add an HTMX dropdown to filter transactions by `status` (e.g., show only "flagged" transactions).
   - Add a search bar to filter transactions by `merchant` name.
   - Add a pagination to the table.

3. **Basic Auditing Actions**  
   - Add an "Approve" button next to each transaction (HTMX-powered) to update `status` from "pending" → "completed" without reloading the page.
   - Add a "Flag" button next to each transaction (HTMX-powered) to update `is_flagged` from "False" → "True" without reloading the page.

4. **Simple Reporting**  
   - Show total transaction amounts for each status (e.g., "Total Completed: $X, Total Flagged: $Y").
   - Show total transaction amounts for each merchant.

## AI Collaboration Rules

- **Allowed**:
  - Full use of AI for frontend code (HTML/CSS/JS/HTMX).
  - You can "discuss" the logic with AI, but the final code must be reviewed and written by you. You will be asked to explain your decisions during the review.
- **Minimum**: 80% of the backend/Django logic must be written by you.
- **Required**:
  - Add **code comments** explaining key AI-generated logic. (**MUST NOT BE GENERATED BY AI**)
  - Be prepared to **verbally explain** how the architecture works during review.

---

## MinimumExpected Deliverables  

1. A GitHub repository containing:  
   - Full Django project with the `transaction` model and seed data.  
   - HTMX-integrated dashboard with filtering/approval.  
   - Basic reporting.
2. A `README.md` explaining how to run the project.

---

## Bonus (Optional)

1. Add a REST API endpoint (Django REST Framework) to fetch transactions as JSON.  
2. Dockerize the app for local development.  
3. Implement basic role-based permissions (e.g., only admins can approve transactions).  

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Filtering, approval, and reporting work as described.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, DRY code with proper Python and Django conventions.
- **HTMX Usage**: Smooth async interactions without page reloads. (Not required, but encouraged)
- **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions in the README.

We value engineers who can **augment their skills with AI** while maintaining deep ownership of architecture and system design. This task reflects our real-world workflows where AI accelerates development but doesn’t replace critical thinking.
